# Basic Phase Distortion

This custom oscillator was designed for the Korg NTS-1 Nu:Tekt digital synthesizer. It is a simple program which implements the classic non-linear phase distortion method. The program serves as the foundation for a series of programs that implement a technique called Vector Phaseshaping.

## 1 - Controls 
This program has only one parameter which can be set with the primary function of the A knob. This parameter controls the amount of phase distortion. The midpoint of the A knob range is the centre value about which increases or decreases will distort the phase of the oscillator.

## 2 - Project Build
